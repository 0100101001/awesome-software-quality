### Intro

There is a list of [free programming ebooks](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books).
And I have decided to create a similar list but for [software testing books](/free-software-testing-books.md). And now we have not only lists with books [in English](/free-software-testing-books.md) and [Russian](/free-software-testing-books-ru.md), but also [courses](/free-software-testing-courses.md) and [podcasts](/free-software-testing-podcasts.md).
